Game Simulation for NCAA Basketball

## Work in progress

Simulation.R is the main simulation script. It will take input from team analysis scripts (not yet developed) and then simulate a game.  
Time Analysis.R is an EDA script to look at the shot clock usage distributions for different activities. I will sample from these distributions for the simulated game.
